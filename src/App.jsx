        🌸 Intro – A Beautiful Bond Called Friendship 🌸

Sometimes, friendship doesn’t start with big moments — it begins with a small smile, a casual “hi,” or just one unexpected glance 👀💫. Little by little, that one person starts meaning more than you ever imagined. What began as a simple connection in class slowly turned into something unforgettable — full of laughter 😂, late-night talks 🌙, care ❤️, fights 😤, and endless memories 💭.

From sharing notes 📚 to sharing feelings 💌, from random conversations to emotional confessions 🥺, every moment became a chapter in our story. You became my comfort zone, my favorite person to talk to, and the one who could change my mood with just a single word 🌈✨.

This is not just a story of friendship — it’s a bond filled with emotions, trust, and countless memories that I’ll cherish forever 💞. Through every smile, every tear, every misunderstanding, and every comeback — our friendship only grew stronger 💪💖.

        The first time I saw you was in class 😍 — and honestly, I looked at you just like how I used to “sight” everyone 😅 but something about you hit different 💫. Then I saw you sitting next to Nive, all serious like a topper 📚😂 and I kept noticing you. After that, wherever I went, somehow you were there too! 😄

Then as usual, you know how it goes — in the lab, because Dhanusiya was talking to you, I also joined in and started a convo 😜. You talked so sweetly, and that day night itself I found your Insta ID 😎✨. I followed you, we started talking little by little 💬💗. You told me about your friends, but deep down I was like, “Hmm, she’s definitely single!” 😏🤣

Slowly, those chats turned into something special 💞. Whenever you talked, I felt so happy and relaxed 😌. Then we started sharing notes and secrets too 🥰. On Sep 21, that Sunday afternoon, when you opened up about your past 💔, I decided I should never hurt this girl again — but now I think I’m the one who’s been torturing you 😅🙃.

On Sep 22, I realized my mistake and felt so hurt 😔. I was scared you’d stop talking to me. You were the first girl (after mom 🥹) who cared for me so much, asked if I ate 🍽️, and genuinely looked after me. That care made me feel special 💖. I told myself, never lose this girl.

Then came that one day when you said, “Close the doors completely.” That hit me harder than Sep 22 🥲. But after that, we became best friends — not just friends, but so close that we knew everything about each other. 🤝💞

I still remember — when you had your problem, you shared it with me before even your mom 😭. That’s when I knew our bond was real ❤️.

        On Oct 2, when you went home 🏡, I missed you badly 🥺 — like, really missed you. Even you missed me too 🥰. When you came back, everything was back to normal. You started walking with me, and no matter what others said, you never left my side 💫.

Then came that unforgettable day — Ayudha Pooja holidays 🎉. When you gave me your hand 🤝, it was the first time I ever held a girl’s hand (except mom & athai 😅). My heart skipped a beat 💓 — that moment, I felt pure happiness. I wanted to hold it again 😳.

Later, when you didn’t let go of my hand for a while, my heart was doing a full happy dance 🕺💃. After that, we got even closer 🥰.

Then one day at the apartment, Vijay came and said hi 👋 — you talked for one minute, and I got super possessive 😤😂. I got tensed, walked away, but later everything went back to normal.

Then came Diwali 🎆 — you went home, and I didn’t expect to miss you that much, but I did 🥺. Those seven days — first three were full of fights 😤, next four full of missing and love ❤️. I’ll never forget when I asked to rest on your shoulder 🥹, and you actually said yes 😳💞. That one-minute moment was unforgettable 🕰️✨.

Even when I felt low, you understood me without me saying a word 💭. You always cared.

    <div className='para1' data-aos="fade-right">
      <p>When you got hurt near your eye 😢, I brought ointment and chocolate 🍫 — and your reaction made me melt 😍. You even said, “I want your shoulder.” That was the cutest moment ever 💕.

Then, everything went normal again until that one day you said you might leave 😭. I cried like crazy 😭 — even my kerchief was fully wet 🥹. That’s why I gave you a 9/10 rating 😂. Please don’t ever do that again 😣.

When you went home again, even for one day, I missed you a lotttttt 😭. Yesterday, when you touched my hand in the SF area, and you said, “Don’t keep it there,” I got scared thinking maybe you don’t like me anymore 😢. But then you said you felt safe and happy — that made my whole day 🥰.

Even when I said I’m taking a break, you were the first person who felt emotional 🥹. You even told your brother that I’m like a small kid to you 🫶. That line made my heart so full 🥺❤️.

You got possessive too when you heard that guy chatting for 6 hours 😂 — and I felt sooo happy because you actually care 💕.

      <p>On November 9, when I gifted you that website 🎁💻, I never imagined it would touch your heart the way it did 💔➡️💖, because in my mind it was just something I made with effort, but for you it became something emotional, something alive ✨, and when you cried 😭—not for a moment, not for an hour, but almost the entire day—I stood there confused, overwhelmed, and a little broken inside 😔🥺, wondering how something I created could make tears fall from your eyes like rain 🌧️. I even asked so many girls 🤔, questioning whether it was really that special, and every answer came back the same—that it was special because it carried my hard work, my time, my intention 💪✨, and that was the day I understood that feelings don’t measure logic, they only feel 💭❤️. That same day, when people casually spoke about video calls 📞, I always said “no chance” ❌ with confidence, but suddenly, without planning, without control, I asked you softly, “Will you do a video call?” 🥹📱, and in that second my heart lifted, my breath changed, and I felt like I was floating in the sky 😄🕊️.</p>

        From that moment, our distance slowly disappeared 🤍, you started booking slots for me 🗓️🤝, standing by me quietly, and with every small help, we moved closer without even realizing it 💞. In special lab, studying Machine Lab together on Google Meet 💻📚 felt less like studying and more like sharing time, and even after college ended, my eyes searched only for your face 😊, finding excuses just to see you again 😅💖. Everything felt smooth, warm, and hopeful 🌈✨, but whenever you failed to clear a slot, every single attempt broke something inside me 😔💔, and though I smiled outside, my heart cried silently for you 😢. One day you didn’t come to college 🏫❌, and during the SF meeting, when I took photos for the first time with Sibi akka 📸 and later with Nivetha akka 😊, your words—asking whether we took pictures without you—cut deep 🥹, and I realised how many times I had unknowingly hurt you, little by little, day by day 💔. After PT exams 📄, classes faded away, slots repeated endlessly 😅🗂️, and when 500rp got deducted because of Joy 😞💸, none of it mattered to you—you walked straight to me, held my hand 🤝, and stayed beside me 🥺💞, and in that quiet moment, my heart screamed that I was not alone anymore 🫶💖.

      Then came the storms in the Infinity Roast group 😞, misunderstandings, pain, and you standing inside it, getting hurt silently 💔, and during our first Truth or Dare game on Google Meet 🎮💻, when you said you would miss me from this college 🥹💓, my heart overflowed with butterflies 🦋🦋🦋, even though I lied and named someone else as my crush 😔. Small fights came and went 😕, but every time, words failed and eyes spoke 👀🤍, healing what was broken without sound. The day you tried for a slot again and cried in SF 😭, resting your head on my shoulders 🥺, I held that moment close, doing everything I could to protect you 🤍🫂. Then came that Sunday 🏥, when I disappeared into silence, didn’t call, didn’t text, didn’t even ask if you ate 😞, and I know that silence hurt more than words 💔, and for that I am deeply sorry, rasathi 🥺💛. After that, time gifted me the most beautiful week of my life ✨💫, when our special lab sir was absent for ten days 😄, and laughter filled the air 😆💞—hands resting, heads leaning, shy touches 😳🤍, my hand on your waist 😶‍🌫️, yours inside my shirt 😳, and hearts racing with nothing but butterflies 🦋🦋🦋. Watching Sita Ramam together 🎬💖 became a memory stitched into my soul, and on the last day of special lab, when you were on your periods 😔, I tried in every small way to care for you 🤍🫶. I still remember that quiet moment in the veranda 🌅, just you and me, the world paused, my hand on your waist, calling you “my thango” 🥹💞.

          Exams arrived 📚😔, conversations reduced, and my possessiveness grew like a shadow 😞, involving others and hurting you 💔, and I regret that deeply, thango 🙏. That night when I said something careless—that if you loved someone else even my hand wouldn’t touch you 💔—your tears flowed for two long hours 😭, and those tears still echo inside me. Christmas came 🎄, and even while at Joy’s house 🏠, my thoughts walked into shops 🛍️, picking a keychain and a hair band 🎁 just for you, and when I gave them to you on a day we went to college alone 🥹, happiness filled me completely 😊💖, especially when you ate Dairy Milk in front of me 🍫, making me feel like I was feeding you myself 🥺💞. No matter who enters my life, no matter what the future writes—even if a future wife appears—you will always hold a place in my heart 🤍✨. That is how 2025 ended for us 🥹📸, wrapped in memories, and when my madness pulled me away after V2T 😔, my silence hurt you again, and for that I am sorry, thango 🙏; I never said how much I missed you, but I missed you endlessly, kiruki 🥺💔. I became overly possessive through others 😞, yet even when I stayed quiet, you searched for me, came to me, called me kiruka 🥹💖, and slowly, after two days, light returned 😊. When I video-called you from the hostel 📱 and saw your face, tears fell without warning 😭, and once again, you made me feel safe, calm, and whole 🤍🫂. I love the way you are possessive 💕, I love you exactly as you are, and I meant it when I said I continued the Igloo movie only because it was with you 🎬—with anyone else, I would have walked away ❌—because with you, I am comfortable, real, and myself, rasathi 🥹💖, and you truly, deeply, endlessly mean so much to me, thangameeee 🫶✨💛🦋🌙
